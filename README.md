### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Collin Henderson (he/him)

- 🌟&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built and run [Astral](https://github.com/astralapp/astral) — the best way to search and organize your GitHub stars
- 🎁&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building [UnderWraps](https://underwraps.gift) — a simple tool for managing anonymous gift exchanges (frequently known as _Secret Santa_)
- 👪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created [Knot](https://github.com/knotworks) — a self-hosted social network for families and other small groups
- 📡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes work on side projects live on Twitch. [Drop me a follow](https://www.twitch.tv/syropian) to be notified when I go live! (Currently on a hiatus, but hoping to get back into it soon!)

#### Favourite Stack?

I've really been vibing with the **VITL** stack — that's **V**ue, **I**nertia.js, **T**ailwind, and **L**aravel. I use Vue 3 with `<script setup>`, TypeScript, and the Composition API.
